### üíª TO DO React

In this challenge, I developed a task control application in the style of **to-do list** , which contains the following functionalities:

- Add a new task
- Mark and unmark a task as done
- Remove a task from the list
- Show task completion progress
- Save list to localStorage

While this is some functionality, you will need to recall concepts such as:

- [x] React with Typescript;
- [x] Use the Vite;
- [x] localStorage 
- [x] hooks;
- [x] States(State immutability)
- [x] I used methods for manipulating arrays like map and filter.
- [x] Understanding the lists and keys in ReactJS
- [x] Properties
- [x] Components(Componentization)
- [x] Iterating in TSX
- [x] Include popular icons in my React projects easily with react-icons
- [x] Logic and Algorithms with Javascript(Typescript);
- [x] Style and format application CSS modules;
- [x] Building the application in blocks with components with the ReactJS tool;
- [x] A README.md file with specifications on how to run the project in a dev environment.
- [x] It meets the model proposed in Figma and contains elements indicative of action and state.
